### Movie Ticket Booking System using SQL & Python
 A console/web-backend application in Python that connects to an SQL database to let users view movies, check showtimes, select seats, and purchase/hold tickets — with admin CRUD operations, concurrency-safe bookings, and simple reporting.

## Project overview

This project demonstrates how to build a movie ticket booking system where:

Movies, theaters, and shows are stored in an SQL database.

Seat availability and bookings are tracked reliably.

Python is used for the application layer (CLI, REST API, or both).

Admins can add/update/delete movies and shows.

Bookings are made transactionally (preventing double booking).

## Tech stack

Database: MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite (choose). (Examples use MySQL syntax; SQLite requires minor changes.)

Python: 3.10+

## Libraries:

mysql-connector-python or psycopg2 or built-in sqlite3

sqlalchemy (optional — recommended for portability)

Flask or FastAPI (if exposing a REST API)

pytest for tests

python-dotenv for environment variables

Tools: Git, Docker (optional)
